Man mentioned in [[Handout 1 - Newspaper.png]]. 

[[Prince Gabriel Constantinovich]] thinks that he killed [[Francisca]] in February, 1920, here in Berlin.

He is dead. 

Had a flat in [[Silesian Station]] (frequented nearest bar, The Red Mill Cabaret).

Apparently picked up many women, but didn't kill all of them like he did [[Francisca|Sasnovski]].

Ms. Berber told us that "Grossman" was the reason [[Francisca|Sasnovski]] was traumatized.

In delerium, seen by [[Claudia]] as sitting on her chest after she was shot in [[Silesian Station]].
