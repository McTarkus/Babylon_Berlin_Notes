# Goal
Find out if [[Carl Grossman]] killed [[Francisca]] by 8pm, Friday, the 23rd

# Research

After some changing stats, [[Hermann]] gets the chance to re-identify the [[Swastika]] seen before: He knows it:
- Means "Good Fortune" generally
- is almost 10,000 years old
- Represented in almost any culture
- More specifically the shape we saw means:
	- Fertility
	- Fire
	- Well-Being
	- Hammer of Thor
	- Has been associated with the Aryan "Volkish" people:
	- "Volkish" is pagan inspired

[[Claudia]] finds what she knows about [[Anastasia]]:
- Tabloid rumors are that she is alive.
- The soviet government has said nothing about this, but have said they killed all the other royal family.

We go through possible clues: 
- We could head to the [[Andreasplatz]].
- We could head to [[Carl Grossman]]'s' flat mentioned in [[Handout 1 - Newspaper.png]]
- The [[Silesian Station]] is mentioned in [[Handout 1 - Newspaper.png]]. (Conveniently the [[Landsburger Tenements]] are at the edge of this part of town. This is an area of town that is somewhat uncouth.) 
- Who is [[Inspector Krieg]]?

We decide that [[Hermann]] should go talk to the police and [[Inspector Krieg]].  But, it's late in the evening, the police will not likely be available at the time we arrive. He should talk in the morning.

After much deliberation [[Handwaffe]] and [[Claudia]] will go talk to possible friends of [[Francisca]] at the [[Andreasplatz]], and [[Karl]] and [[Hermann]] will go talk to possible aquaintences of [[Carl Grossman]].

## [[Silesian Station]]

It is about midnight arriving at the [[Andreasplatz]]. There are pigeons, trash, revelers, tramps.

I say that Claudia and Handwaffe should go talk to a prostitute, start the investigation.
	- They walk up to one that looks legal, blonde and pretty.

They ask if she knows [[Francisca]], and she asks for money for information. 
Claudia says they're police, but the prostitute does not believe it from their dress. 
A conflict ensues due to the inability to pay the money she asks for.
They leave knowing nothing.

Going to the others, we go first to the flats of [[Carl Grossman]], and then pick the nearest bar (The Red Mill Cabaret). 
- There is a large doorman, people milling about. It's very red. Smells of piss. We are lead to a table. A little stage has a pit and banjo players and a ventriloquist. Cross dressers, people taking hits. We try to come up with a plan.
- A small man/woman? arrives to the table and asks what we want. I am paralyzed. 
- The place is confusing. 

- [[Handwaffe]] and [[Claudia]] wander in. They are playing piano and doing shots?

We must go speak to the bartender. She is wearing makeup? 

[[Carl Grossman]] was always at this bar. Picked up women frequently. 
She knows he was arrested for killing girls he picked up at the bar. She is annoyed at the questions. 
Many that had sex with him did not die, but she is annoyed at the question. 

On the way out, a beautiful, movie-star gorgeous woman walks in with a square-jawed American sailor-looking man. She has blonde hair, blue eyes, draws all eyes toward her. 

The man at the door says "Mrs. Berber, your coat?" She silently hands off her coat, she is completely nude underneath except for her pumps. She then heads to a booth where nobody is sitting and it seems she becomes very popular. 

[[Claudia]] asks why the woman is nude. She is almost laughed away, this is a nonsense question to ask. This is how it works. 

We all meet up and decide that [[Claudia]] should be the one to speak to Mrs. Berber. Hesitantly, she walks up. There is a little monkey at the table. Claudia mentions that she plays music. The woman asks if she sings, and kisses Claudia. Then heads to the stage. 

She sings a song of a garden full of orchids, being tangled alive, It appears that Claudia is being used as a prop.  Then she is invited to bring her friends to her table.

I am dragged to the table. It appears she is bigger than she seems, a movie star of some sort.

She offers a ring with a little divot of white powder. [[Handwaffe]] smells all up her arm and she bats him down friendlily. This woman is very flirtatious, methinks.

She asks what *I* want. I say we are looking after a friend, [[Francisca|Sasnovski]]. Miss Berger says that she knows this girl, she went crazy and threw herself in the river to be dragged out. She was traumatized by something, she doesn't say mroe than ""[[Carl Grossman|Grossman]]"".  

I ASK IF SHE DOES FILMS. SHE MUST BE IN FILMS. She says of course, asks if I know any. I do not.

The conversation becomes drunken and addled. We are kicked from the table. We leave the bar.
# Kicked Out

A middle-eastern looking man pulls out a gun and says "give me everything you have. I'll kill you." He looks desparate.

Everything rushes in to grab him, except I Dodge.  There is a gunshot. Claudia is hit and I rush to her aid while Handwaffe *saws his hand off?* as [[Karl]] sits on him. 

Claudia passes out while I perform First Aid successfully, seeing the eyes of cats in the alley and what looks like [[Carl Grossman]] on her chest.
