# [[Romanisches Cafe]]

We have recieved a telegram to meet at noon at the [[Romanisches Cafe]], awaiting further message. This area is traditionally leftist, many fruity types ("Otto Dix!") nearby. 

I order some potatoes and a lunchtime beer. The other men do too, but [[Claudia]] has a young person's coffee.

A boy comes to the table, hands a note to us. He can't see the person who gave it to him. 

There is a note inside a newspaper.

The note says "Meet at the [[Hotel Roter Adler]], 4:30. Dress Nice. Like Kings."

The newspaper is:
![[Handout 1 - Newspaper.png]]

As we look at the newspaper, a truck enters the plaza. It honks its horn, and several of the crowd get up and leave. The truck is marked with a skull and the phrase "[[Organisation Consul]]." 

A large man gets out with other military looking types. He gives a speech on what the Organisation is doing to help the people. I take a photo of him. After a time, a drinking song starts.

A man who has just had a waitress storm off from him, walks up to [[Claudia]] and starts small-talk. He doesn't get the memo that she is not interested. 

The friend of the man starts to throw plates around? He doesn't listen to me as I tell him to stop. Claudia notices a strange symbol (now known as a [[swastika]]) on the back of the plates he is throwing. 

The man in charge from the truck rushes over to get him to stop. Apologizes to [[Claudia]], asks her what he can do to make this right. Then, he is distracted by a fight that ensues between two men at another cafe in the square. After a time, it is broken up by the man. 

Then, we pay our bills (exhorbitant). We do not recognize the symbol on the plate. We adjourn to put on our nicest clothes at the [[Landsburger Tenements]].

# [[Hotel Roter Adler]]

I head out early after changing to search the [[Hotel Roter Adler]] libary of occult materials. I am escorted to the elevator as a member of the [[Order of the Owl]] is due. 

The record-keeper of [[Order of the Owl|The Order]] walks in and introduces himself and other members of the group.

He says: 
- Someone very influential contacted [[Order of the Owl|The Order]] for help. They need someone very sympathetic to the monarchy. 
- He pulls out a telegram: ![[Handout 2 - Telegram.png]]
- [[Prince Gabriel Constantinovich]] was a prince of Russia, previously staying in France. He must have come to Germany.

# [[Eden Hotel]]

We agree to help and make plans to head to the [[Eden Hotel]].

We arrive and go up to the room 415 listed on the telegram. A bearded man stops us for security outside the room. 

The room is covered in beautiful furniture and artwork. The bearded man offers us refreshments. He speaks Russian. 

A pinch-faced man in regalia (very slavik). He introduces himself and wishes us a good evening in perfect German. The [[Prince Gabriel Constantinovich]]. [[Handwaffe]] mentions that he saw him staring at us while at [[Romanisches Cafe]].

He says:
- He is here for a strict bit of business. 
- We were suggested to him as people that could provide help. 
- He mentions the Czar Romanov family that were killed years earlier. 
- He visited the cellar where the family was shot.
	- A crack was in the wall with what his organisation believes is a lucky symbol and a journal belonging to the lost Czarina [[Anastasia]] Romanov.
- The story reported in Germany of [[Carl Grossman]] lead to him being under suspicion. His organization believes that a woman named [[Francisca]] may have been killed by this man in February, 1920 here in Berlin. 
	- The journal mentioned a woman named Sasnovski, who he believes is [[Francisca]].
- In fact [[Anastasia]] may in fact be friends with [[Francisca]].
	- [[Francisca]] worked at the [[Andreasplatz]].
- If we can find out whether [[Carl Grossman]] killed [[Francisca]] by 8pm, Friday, the 23rd, we will recieve 40 British pounds, with 15 more given now for taking the job.
- At [[Claudia]]'s prodding he mentions the symbol is in fact a swastika, [[Anastasia]]'s lucky symbol.
	- [[Francisca]] would be nineteen when on the street, petit, strawberry blonde hair, blue eyes, attractive.
	- He has no personal knowledge of her, just from what he can find. He hasn't actually seen the journal personally.

We toast to the Romanovs and leave the [[Hotel Roter Adler]]. The Session ends
